        <h2>The First Female Teacher of India</h2>
        <p>
          <b>&nbsp &nbsp Savitribai Phule</b> was an Indian social reformer, educationalist, and poet from Maharashtra.
          Along with
          her husband, Mahatma Jyotiba Phule in Maharashtra, she played an important and vital role in improving women's
          rights in India. She is considered to be the pioneer of India's feminist movement. Savitribai and her husband
          founded one of the early modern Indian girls' school in Pune, at Bhide wada in 1848. Robert May of the London
          Missionary Society was the first person to open a school exclusively for girls[3] in the region of Chinsurah,
          Bengal, in 1818. She worked to abolish the discrimination and unfair treatment of people based on caste and
          gender.

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
          &nbsp Savitribai was born on January 3rd, 1831 in Naigaon village in Maharashtra. At that time being born in a
          socially backward Mali community meant no education for females. She was illiterate when she married Jyotiba
          Phule at the age of 9. Jyotiba was 13 at that time and studied in class 3rd. Savitribai found her route to
          education due to her forward-looking husband Jyotiba Phule who believed strongly in female education to remove
          social inequalities. He began teaching his wife at home against the family diktat.

        <h3>Career</h3>
        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp After completing her teacher's education, Savitribai Phule started teaching girls at the Maharwada
          in Pune.
          She did so alongside Sagunabai Kshirsagar who was a revolutionary feminist as well as a mentor to Jyotirao.
          [citation needed] Not long after beginning to teach with Sagunabai, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule along with
          Sagunabai started their own school at Bhide Wada. Bhide Wada was the home of Tatya Saheb Bhide, who was
          inspired by the work that the trio was doing. The curriculum at Bhide Wada included traditional western
          curriculum of mathematics, science, and social studies. By the end of 1851, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule were
          running three different schools for girls in Pune. Combined, the three schools had approximately one hundred
          and fifty students enrolled. Like the curriculum, the teaching methods employed by the three schools differed
          from those used in government schools. The author, Divya Kandukuri believes that the Phule methods were
          regarded as being superior to those used by government schools. As a result of this reputation, the number of
          girls receiving their education at the Phule's schools outnumbered the number of boys enrolled in government
          schools.</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp Unfortunately, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule's success came with much resistance from the local
          community with conservative views. Kandukuri states that Savitribai often travelled to her school carrying an
          extra sari because she would be assailed by her conservative opposition with stones, dung, and verbal abuse.
          Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule were living at Jyotirao's father's home. However, in 1839, Jyotirao's father
          asked the couple to leave his home because their work was considered a sin as per the Manusmriti and its
          derived Brahmanical texts.</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp After moving out of Jyotirao's father's home, the Phule's moved in with the family
          of one of Jyotirao's friends, Usman Sheikh. It was there that Savitribai met a soon to be close friend and
          colleague named Fatima Begum Sheikh. According to Nasreen Sayyed, a leading scholar on Sheikh, "Fatima Sheikh
          knew how to read and write already, her brother Usman who was a friend of Jyotiba, had encouraged Fatima to
          take up the teacher training course. She went along with Savitribai to the Normal School and they both
          graduated together. She was the first Muslim woman teacher of India". Fatima and Savitribai opened a school in
          Sheikh's home in 1849.</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp In the 1850s, Savitribai and Jyotirao Phule established two educational trusts. They were
          entitled: the
          Native,Male School, Pune and the Society for Promoting the Education of Mahars, Mangs, and Etceteras. These
          two trusts ended up encompassing many schools which were led by Savitribai Phule and later, Fatima Sheikh.</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp Jyotirao summarises Savitribai and his work in an interview given to the Christian missionary
          periodical,
          Dnyanodaya, on 15 September 1853, saying,</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp It did occur to me that the improvement that comes about in a child due to the mother is very
          important and
          good. So those who are concerned with the happiness and welfare of this country should definitely pay
          attention to the condition of women and make every effort to impart knowledge to them if they want the country
          to progress. With this thought, I started the school for girls first. But my caste brethren did not like that
          I was educating girls and my own father threw us out of the house. Nobody was ready to give space for the
          school nor did we have money to build it. People were not willing to send their children to school but Lahuji
          Ragh Raut Mang and Ranba Mahar convinced their caste brethren about the benefits of getting educated.</p>
        <p>&nbsp &nbsp with her husband, she taught children from different castes and had opened a total of 18 schools.
          The couple also opened a care centre called Balhatya Pratibandhak Griha[9] (literally, "Child-killing
          Prohibition Home") for pregnant rape victims and helped deliver and save their children.</p>

        <h3>Death</h3>
        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp Savitribai and her adopted son, Yashwant, opened a clinic to treat those affected by the worldwide
          Third
          Pandemic of the bubonic plague when it appeared in the area around Nalasopara in 1897. The clinic was
          established at stern outskirts of Pune, in an area free of infection. Savitribai died a heroic death trying to
          save the son of Pandurang Babaji Gaekwad. Upon learning that Gaekwad's son had contracted the Plague in the
          Mahar settlement outside of Mundhwa, Savitribai Phule rushed to his side and carried him on her back to the
          hospital. In the process, Savitribai Phule caught the Plague and died at 9:00pm on 10 March 1897.

        <h3>Poetry and Orther Work</h3>
        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp Savitribai Phule was also an author and poet. She published Kavya Phule in 1854 and Bavan Kashi
          Subodh
          Ratnakar in 1892, and also a poem entitled "Go, Get Education" in which she encouraged those who are oppressed
          to free themselves by obtaining an education.[citation needed] As a result of her experience and work, she
          became an ardent feminist. She established the Mahila Seva Mandal to raise awareness for issues concerning
          women's rights. She also called for a gathering place for women that was free of caste discrimination or
          differentiation of any kind.[citation needed] Symbolic of this was that all the women that attended were to
          sit on the same mat. She was also an anti-infanticide activist. She opened a women's shelter called the Home
          for the Prevention of Infanticide, where Brahmin widows could safely deliver their children and leave them
          there to be adopted if they so desired. She also campaigned against child marriage and was an advocate of
          widow remarriage. Savitribai and Jyotirao strongly opposed Sati Pratha, and they started a home for
          widows and forlorn children.</p>
        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp In a letter to her husband Jyotirao, Savitribai told the story about a boy about to be lynched by
          his fellow
          villagers for having relations with a woman of lower caste when Savitribai intervened. She wrote, "I came to
          know about their murderous plan. I rushed to the spot and scared them away, pointing out the grave
          consequences of killing the lovers under the British law. They changed their mind after listening to me".
